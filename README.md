## Overview

Welcome to `PHP-Evolution-Journey` - a comprehensive guide and code repository demonstrating the evolution of PHP from version 5 to version 8. This repository aims to provide clear examples and explanations of the key features and changes introduced in each significant PHP version.

## Contents
- [PHP 4 Examples](/php4_examples)
  - Discover the foundational features introduced in PHP 4, including the Zend Engine, improved OOP, and session management.
- [PHP 5 Examples](/php5_examples)
  - Explore the features that marked the new era of PHP with improved OOP, PDO, and more.
- PHP 6 - Not Released
  - PHP 6 was a planned version that never got officially released. It aimed to introduce significant changes, particularly in Unicode support, but due to complex challenges and the evolving priorities of the PHP community, development was halted, and the focus was shifted to what eventually became PHP 7.
- [PHP 7 Examples](/php7_examples)
  - Delve into the innovations brought by PHP 7, including scalar type declarations, new operators, and enhanced error handling.
- [PHP 8 Examples](/php8_examples)
  - Discover the latest features of PHP 8, such as union types, named arguments, attributes, and JIT compilation.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to Version-Specific Directories**: Each major PHP version has its own directory (`php5_examples`, `php7_examples`, `php8_examples`) containing relevant examples and explanations.
   
2. **Read the Examples**: Inside each version's directory, you'll find subdirectories for different features with example code and `README.md` files explaining the feature in detail.

3. **Run and Modify the Code**: Feel free to run the example scripts to see the features in action. You are encouraged to modify the examples to experiment with and better understand each feature.

4. **Compare and Contrast**: Use the examples to compare how different PHP versions approach similar problems or how new features improve upon old methods.
